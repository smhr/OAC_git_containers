## Installing docker

### Going around the blocking of Iran's IP

Unfortunately docker restricts its service for Iran. So you need a workaround. You can use VPN or some other services like [Shekan](https://shecan.ir/) to install docker and use [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/). For more information, see [its FAQ](https://shecan.ir/faq/).

### Installation steps

Depending on your OS and distro, you can install docker. If you use Gnu/Linux, please install [docker server](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) according to the documentation for your platform. If you have Mac or Windows, please install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
